# Creating a Flowchart from a Dependency List

A work by: Parker Landon and Colby Nelson

Implements many different algorithms and concepts learned in Algortims and Analysis such as topolological ordering and a modified interval scheduling. This flowchart is deployed locally to a webpage with a UI and animations done by Parker Landon.

## Description

This project takes in JSON files with all courses you need to take to complete and prerequisites you need in order to take all classes in order to achieve a bachelors of science in computer science or a bachelors of science in mathmatics at SPU. We implemented this using prodiminately TypeScript with some Javascript. 

## Requirements

Node.js and npm -> To install run 'npm install --save --legacy-peer-deps' in flowchart-10xers directory.

## User Manual

  1. Clone the repository to Github Desktop and open with VS Code or desired IDE.
  2. Install node.js and npm using the specified command above.
  3. Start the application using 'npm run dev' in the flowchart-10xers directory.

## Reflection

  This was a fun project to do because it had a lot of relevance to students at SPU and could be a very useful tool for students to use with a little more polish. Parker and I have never worked together before, but Parker may be one of the best group members I have had in group projects. As you know I struggled in Algorithms and had to focus a lot of my time to studying for the final. Parker was incredibly understanding and worked really had to make sure that I completed tasks and when I was unable to complete tasks, he was picking up slack where I fell down. Most of the information that we needed, we learned in a lot of deapth in class so that was another cool and enjoyable part of this project was to apply what we had learned in class into a real world application of learnings. Finally, I am not the best at web development and Parker is a solid web developer, and I got some more practice in web development thanks and our choosen stratagey for deployment.
